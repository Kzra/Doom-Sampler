To use, download [sforzando a free SFZ compliant sample player](https://www.plogue.com/products/sforzando.html) from Plogue.  
With sforzando running in standalone mode, or in a DAW, open one of the folders and drag the .sfz file of your choice over the user interface; the samples will load automatically. 

.sfz files are as follows:
- guns: DOOM and DOOM II gun samples
- monsters: DOOM, DOOM II monster samples
- other: DOOM and DOOM II environment and other samples 
- all: all the above sounds, separated by octaves

Keys are mapped to either a single sound, or a round robin of related sounds. Have a look at the .sfz files and [this guide](https://sfzformat.com) for more information!
